# 💼 Role System

---

Role System is a 1.20 Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers. It assigns specific roles to players. The way it assigns the roles depends on the selected config options. Depending on their job, players may or may not perform some actions (e.g: a farmer cannot mine diamond). 

This enhances exchanges and helps developping a real economy between players. It's also a good way to prevent farming and highlight the need of cooperation.

I was looking for such a plugin for almost two years... I couldn't find one, so I figured I would code it myself. 80% of what the plugin does if configurable in the config file.

## ⚙️ Installation

- Install Spigot 1.20 on your Minecraft server by following [a documentation](https://hub.tcno.co/games/minecraft/1.20/server/spigot/) online.
- Drag and drop the RoleSystem.jar in your plugins folder
- Restart the server
- See the config.yml file and edit it as you like, or leave it as is
- Reload to upload your modifications

## 💾 Player Database 

I handled the player roles database and the available roles/roles counts database using .csv files to be found in the RoleSystem folder (must have restarted/reloaded the server after installing the plugin).

You can modify some parameters in the csv files directly, but I highly encourage you to rather do what you have to do using commands.

## 📜 Post Scriptum

The plugin is not 100% finished as I kind of lost motivation and discontinued it for now... But if you want to see more things, feel free to contact me! I may work on the project again.
